        <p>Figaro's favourite colour is blue. <em>Oliver</em> knows this because he had a pen with a <strong>blue</strong> feathery bird on the
            top of it that Fig would always obsess over. Figgy would always find this pen no matter where it was, and play with it. So now Oliver claims that blue must be figs favourite colour.
